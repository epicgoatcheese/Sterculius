# This section is designed for large servers (or modpacks) to finely tune performance. It's not recommended to touch this as a singleplayer user, although lower end PC's can see increased performance. Servers will see massive performance improvements by raising the below values, however they are not without cost. This alters a Wild Pokemon's tick rate. For example, if you were to set tickRate24Radius to 5, you will see very visible stutters in a Pokemon's movement. This is why we recommend keeping the value low. Even so, by default they tick every single tick. Simply raising to 2 will double your performance and Pokemon still move smoothly. Raising any of the values to 3 is where you'll start seeing some slower movements, which are not noticeable the further the player is. Remember, there are 20 ticks per second.
